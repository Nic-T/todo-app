*todo-app*

A simple todo app made with the PERN stack. It uses PostgreSQL as database, backend node with react and frontend React. 
The connection to the database is made with pg and the transactions with cors.

On the frontend, i mostly imported useState and Fragment.

The app gives the user the possibility to create, update and delete tasks.
